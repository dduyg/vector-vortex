# 🌊 AquaSynth: A Seapunk Emoji Reef Generator

**AquaSynth** is a playful, seapunk-inspired web toy that lets you generate mesmerizing underwater worlds using only emojis! Customize your ocean grid, populate it with all manner of aquatic creatures, treasures, and shimmering scenery, and watch as your own procedurally generated seascape comes to life.

## 🌐 What is AquaSynth?

AquaSynth is an interactive, browser-based **emoji tilemap generator** that creates colorful, aquatic-themed "reefscapes." Users control the size of the grid and the number of creatures and treasures, and each click produces a new, unique ocean tableau.

- **Procedural emoji art**: Each scene is unique thanks to random placement of emojis.
- **Highly customizable**: Choose your ocean size, adjust how lively or treasure-filled it is.
- **Seapunk vibes**: Themed visuals and emoji palette inspired by the retro-futuristic, aquatic subculture.

## ⚓️ How It Works

1. **Set your parameters**: Choose the grid dimensions, the number of ocean creatures, and the number of treasures.
2. **Generate your reef**: Click "Refresh!" to create a brand new underwater emoji scene.
3. **Enjoy and share**: Copy, screenshot, or simply enjoy your one-of-a-kind ocean tableau!

Behind the scenes, AquaSynth uses a random algorithm to fill a grid with background "tiles" (waves, coral, bubbles, etc.), then sprinkles in creatures (octopus, fish, merfolk, etc.) and treasures (anchors, gems, islands, etc.).
