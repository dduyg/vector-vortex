[Generates](https://dduyg.github.io/aquatic-arrays/) grid-based "oceanscapes". The oceanscape is a 2D array of aquatic emojis, randomly populated according to your settings.

## `How It Works`
1️⃣  Set size of your ocean grid using the input boxes labeled with 🌊 to set the number of columns and rows (e.g., 10 x 10).

2️⃣  Choose how many 🧜‍♀️ "visitors" (sea creatures) to include and decide how many 🐚 "treasures" (special objects) are scattered.

3️⃣  Click the generate button to create a new ocean scene. The emoji grid will update with a unique pattern each time.
