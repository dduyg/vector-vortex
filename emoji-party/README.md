# Emoji Ocean 🪸🧜‍♀️
[Generates](https://dduyg.github.io/emoji-ocean) grid-based "oceanscapes". The oceanscape is a 2D array of aquatic emojis, randomly populated according to your settings.

## 🛟 How It Works
- Set size of your ocean grid using the input boxes labeled with 🌊 to set the number of columns and rows (e.g., 10 x 10).
- Choose how many 🧜‍♀️ "visitors" (sea creatures) to include and decide how many 🐚 "treasures" (special objects) are scattered.
 - Click the generate button to create a new ocean scene. The emoji grid will update with a unique pattern each time.

## ⚓️ Technical Details
